Here are step-by-step instructions to download a file from Google Drive using the command line API if the file is shared privately and needs authentication.

Get the file ID:

    Go to your Google Drive in your browser.
    Right-click (or control-click) the file you want to download and click “Get shareable link”. The link looks like this: https://drive.google.com/open?id=XXXXX. Make note of the file ID “XXXXX”; you will be needing it below.

Get an OAuth token:

    Go to OAuth 2.0 Playground  https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/

    In the “Select the Scope” box, scroll down, expand “Drive API v3”, and select https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
    Click “Authorize APIs” and then “Exchange authorization code for tokens”. Copy the “Access token”; you will be needing it below.

Download the file from the command line:

If using OS X or Linux, open the “Terminal” program and enter the following command.

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YYYYY" https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/XXXXX?alt=media -o ZZZZZ 

If using Windows, open the “PowerShell” program and enter the following command.

    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/XXXXX?alt=media -Method Get -Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer YYYYY"} -OutFile ZZZZZ 

In your command, replace “XXXXX” with the file ID from above, “YYYYY” with the access token from above, and “ZZZZZ” with the file name that will be saved (for example, “myFile.mp4” if you’re downloading an mp4 file).

Press Enter and let the download begin.
