some simple spreadshhet to remember gdb commands

#print source listing
l, list location   # Print lines centered around the line specified by location.
   list first,last # Print lines from first to last. Both arguments are locations.
                   # When a list command has two locations, and the source file of the second location is omitted,
                   # this refers to the same source file as the first location.
   list ,last      # Print lines ending with last.
   list first,     # Print lines starting with first.
   list +          # Print lines just after the lines last printed.
   list -          # Print lines just before the lines last printed.
   list            # same as list -

Location can be specified in these ways:
  LINENUM, to list around that line in current file,
+-LINECOUNT Specifies the line offset lines before/after the last line printed.
  FILE:LINENUM, to list around that line in that file,
  FUNCTION, to list around beginning of that function,
  FILE:FUNCTION, to distinguish among like-named static functions.
  *ADDRESS, to list around the line containing that address.
